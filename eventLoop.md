Question: What is event loop?
Answer: Event loop is nothing but a program (which is part of the libuv library) that keeps a track whether the Call Stack is empty or not, and if it is, then it pulls out the next function from the event queue/callback queue and puts it in the call stack for further execution.

The event loop is a fundamental concept in Node.js, enabling it to perform non-blocking I/O operations despite being single-threaded. Understanding the event loop is crucial for writing efficient Node.js applications. Below, I'll explain the event loop in detail, including how it works, its phases, and how it handles asynchronous operations.

### Overview

Node.js uses an event-driven architecture where the event loop handles all asynchronous operations. The event loop continuously checks for events and executes the corresponding callback functions. This mechanism allows Node.js to handle numerous simultaneous operations without the need for multiple threads.

### How the Event Loop Works

1. **Initialization**: When a Node.js application starts, it initializes the event loop and executes the input script (your main file).
2. **Asynchronous Operations**: Asynchronous operations such as I/O tasks, timers, and network requests are offloaded to the system's kernel or worker threads.
3. **Event Loop Phases**: The event loop proceeds through several phases, each with a specific task to handle different types of callbacks.

### Phases of the Event Loop

The event loop in Node.js has several phases, each handling different types of callbacks. These phases are:

1. **Timers Phase**: This phase executes callbacks scheduled by `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()`.
2. **Pending Callbacks Phase**: This phase handles callbacks deferred to the next iteration of the event loop.
3. **Idle, Prepare Phase**: Internal use only.
4. **Poll Phase**: The poll phase retrieves new I/O events and executes their callbacks.
5. **Check Phase**: This phase executes callbacks scheduled by `setImmediate()`.
6. **Close Callbacks Phase**: This phase handles close events, like when a socket or handle is closed.

### Detailed Breakdown

1. **Timers Phase**:
   - Executes callbacks for timers (`setTimeout` and `setInterval`).
   - Only those timers whose threshold has expired are executed.

2. **Pending Callbacks Phase**:
   - Executes I/O callbacks deferred from the previous cycle.

3. **Idle, Prepare Phase**:
   - For internal operations only.

4. **Poll Phase**:
   - Retrieves new I/O events.
   - Executes I/O related callbacks (excluding those deferred to timers or `setImmediate`).
   - If there are no I/O events to handle, the poll phase will block and wait for them. If callbacks are scheduled by `setImmediate`, it will move to the check phase.

5. **Check Phase**:
   - Executes callbacks scheduled by `setImmediate`.

6. **Close Callbacks Phase**:
   - Executes close callbacks, like `socket.on('close', ...)`.

### Example Demonstration

Hereâ€™s an example that demonstrates how different asynchronous operations are handled by the event loop:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

// Timers
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Timeout callback executed');
}, 0);

// Immediate
setImmediate(() => {
  console.log('Immediate callback executed');
});

// File I/O
fs.readFile(__filename, () => {
  console.log('File read callback executed');
});

// Normal synchronous operation
console.log('Synchronous operation executed');
```

### Output Explanation

When you run the above code, the expected output will be:

```
Synchronous operation executed
File read callback executed
Immediate callback executed
Timeout callback executed
```

#### Explanation:
1. **Synchronous Operation**: This runs immediately as it's not asynchronous.
2. **File Read Callback**: Although `fs.readFile` is asynchronous, the file read operation often finishes very quickly (since it's reading the current script file), making its callback the first to be executed among asynchronous callbacks.
3. **Immediate Callback**: `setImmediate` is executed in the check phase, after I/O events.
4. **Timeout Callback**: Although `setTimeout` with `0` delay, it's not executed immediately but scheduled for the timers phase in the next event loop cycle.

### Best Practices

1. **Avoid Blocking the Event Loop**: Any blocking operation (e.g., a long-running computation) will block the event loop and degrade performance. Use asynchronous APIs or move heavy computations to worker threads.
2. **Use Promises and Async/Await**: These modern approaches simplify handling asynchronous operations and make the code more readable.
3. **Optimize I/O Operations**: Efficiently manage I/O operations to ensure that the event loop can handle multiple tasks concurrently.

### Conclusion

The event loop is central to Node.js's ability to handle asynchronous operations in a single-threaded environment. By understanding how the event loop works, you can write more efficient and scalable Node.js applications.
